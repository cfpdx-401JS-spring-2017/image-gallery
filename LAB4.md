===

Create a backend server for your app and wire it up!

API:

* GET list of albums
* POST an album
* DELETE an album
* GET all images (or you can provide a detail GET for album that includes images
* POST an image (either stand-alone or to an album)
* DELETE an image (either stand-alone or to an album)

Make sure you can run both in dev mode, and make a production "build" that deploys to public folder of server
